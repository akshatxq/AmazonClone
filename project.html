    <h1>PROJECTS:</h1><HR><br>
        <i>In school, i worked in many projects but one of the major project was in the exhibition,<br> where me and my team worked on making a working model of an active volcano as our science project.<br>
            <img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSYMeZjao0lliKZmy2U_UtPmbtH62lK1szlBA&usqp=CAU" alt="VOLCANO DIAGRAM"><HR>
            <br>
            <p>In this project,<br>firstly we created the structure of volcano using pop(plaster of paris )and a water bottle on strong flat frame.<br>After that we colured it and added some external stuff to make it look more realistic <br> and then filled the volcano with soda and when we added the gum to it .<br>
                The following chemical reaction occured:<br><BR>
                <b>H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>--->H<sub>2</sub>O + CO<SUB>2</SUB></b><BR><HR>
                    <p>this is due due to excess formation of CO<sub>2</sub>gas leading to explosion.<br>
                    so here ,is the working model of a Volcano as explained in the above diagram.</p>
                THANK YOU.
